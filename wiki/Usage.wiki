=== How to setup your Android app to use Firmata ===

This is an early version of android-firmata. The final result will be a library which you can import to your Android project to use its functions.

However, if you cannot wait and you want to use android-firmata right now, you might go through the sample application to see how I made use of functions provided by *BTActivity*.

=== General instructions ===
Basically you extend your Activity with BTActivity.
This gives you two menu items in your Activity: 
  * Bluetooth on/off 
  * Scan for Devices

BTActivity is abstract and you have to implement the following function:

{{{
@Override
public void connectionEstablished() {
  Log.d(TAG, "connected");
 
  /* 1. put your arduino setup code in here */

  /* 2. At the end of this function you might want to start a looper to fetch pin states on a regular basis */
}
}}}

You might use the `connect()` method of BTActivity to connect to the last successful paired device. When connection was successful BTActivity calls `connectionEstablished()` for you. This is where you put your Arduino setup code in and start a looper thread if you want to check pins periodically.
